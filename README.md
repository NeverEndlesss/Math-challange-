# Math-challange
Every working day (Monday to Friday) until May 1, 2024, I will add C++ programs that will solve mathematical problems that will help me better understand the tasks in computer science studies. A total of 45 files will be published on Basic-Math-Challange-In-C++ branch (challenge starts on leap day).
